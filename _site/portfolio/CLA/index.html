<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>In 2014, the College of Liberal Arts (CLA) at the University of Minnesota began a large-scale initiative to migrate the college website and 80+ of the CLA department websites to a modern, mobile-forward, centralized content management system built on <a href="https://www.drupal.org">Drupal 7</a>.</p>

<p>I was hired as a student editor and helped migrate, write, revise, and edit content for the new site. I worked alongside project managers, developers, designers, and writers/editors using content strategy tools developed in conjunction with <a href="http://www.clockwork.net">Clockwork Active Media Systems</a>. I created over 200 individual pages of content and contributed to many more across the <a href="http://cla.umn.edu">CLA main site</a> and its departments. A few of my personal projects include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://cla.umn.edu/history">Department of History</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://cla.umn.edu/polisci">Department of Political Science</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://cla.umn.edu/english">Department of English</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://cla.umn.edu/gwss">Department of Gender, Women &amp; Sexuality Studies</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://cla.umn.edu/public-health-minor">Public Health Minor</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://cla.umn.edu/SJMC">School of Journalism and Mass Communication</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Content strategy and information architecture</h3>

<p>A college's website is key in connecting faculty, staff, and especially students to the resources and information they need to succeed. Rebuilding the website for the largest college at one of the largest research institutions in the country is no small feat; and the development of rich, readable, engaging content was at the heart of the project.</p>

<p>The project involved the use of site maps, content matrices, and collaborative copy documents specially designed by <a href="http://www.clockwork.net">Clockwork</a> to develop the new site's content. Rather than simply reusing old content, we started fresh with the mission statement of the college as our main objective:<p>

<blockquote>"The University of Minnesota College of Liberal Arts prepares students to be independent and original thinkers, to be innovators in their chosen fields, to create meaning in their lifeâ€™s work, and to become productive citizens and leaders in their communities and the world."</blockquote>

<h3>Writing, content optimization, and editing</h3>

<p>We needed to create a website that would be accessible, mobile-friendly, and optimized with engaging content that communicated the key aspects and values of CLA and its departments. This meant thinking broadly not only in terms of design, but also in terms of what information users were seeking and how they were accessing that information. This accessibility-minded, mobile-first approach to writing included many areas of concern:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to place information on pages</li>
  <li>How to write appropriate metadata and teaser lines</li>
  <li>How to caption images and provide alt tags for screen readers</li>
  <li>What content was cross-referenced and/or reusable</li>
  <li>Stylistic and design guidelines</li>
</ul>

<p>Where appropriate, existing content was retooled and revised to populate relevant pages as defined by the standardized sitemap structure. Where there were content holes, I worked closely with subject matter experts in their respective departments to develop new content that was succinct and readable, but still rich in value and that carried the key messages each department had. The process was guided by a grammatical and semantic style guide developed in-house by a fellow writer on the team.</p>

<p>Before each site launched, it went through a QA/copyedit stage. I was responsible for editing for grammar, style, consistency, and adherence to the CLA style guide.</p>

<h3>Site launch and departmental training</h3>

<p>The CLA main site, along with History and the School of Journalism, launched in January of 2015. Many more departments launched in the following months. Throughout the entire process, I was tasked with leading departmental project teams on content curation and revision, as well as training them in the Drupal system. I led the entire content development process and administered user roles and permissions for the entire Department of Psychology.</p>

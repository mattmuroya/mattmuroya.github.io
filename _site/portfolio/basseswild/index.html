<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>As part of a class at the University of Minnesota, I learned and carried out the entire website planning, design, and deployment process of a small-scale informational website for Basses Wild Men's A Cappella, a student group I am involved with. Basses Wild is the University of Minnesota's premiere all-male a cappella group. Basses Wild performs two capstone concerts each year as well as various paid and volunteer gigs around the greater Twin-Cities area.</p>

<p>The website, originally built in 2014, offers information regarding the group's history and current events as well as as audition information and a gig request/contact form. In 2015, I redesigned the site implementing responsive design to accommodate mobile devices.</p>

<h3>Planning</h3>

<p>The planning process consisted of three major components:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Competitive site analysis:</strong> What do competing sites have to offer in terms of design, branding, content quality and site functionality? What organizational strategies are employed and what are the site's technical requirements?</li>

<li><strong>User demographics:</strong> Who is the target demographic? Several factors were considered, including age, gender, income, marital status, education, occupation, geographic location, internet usage habits, interests, and objectives. User demographics were used to help craft the creative strategy.</li>

<li><strong>Creative Strategy:</strong> From business/marketing objectives to brand positioning to visual design and site architecture, there was a lot to address when defining a creative strategy. Primary/secondary audiences, key user benefits, and possible problems and opportunities were considered.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>The design process involved both a design mockup and final code. A prototype website was designed on paper and mocked up using Adobe Photoshop CS6. This stage included color scheme and visual branding decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Conceptual model:</strong> the site mimics many other performance groups' websites, adding an extra visual flare. The grayscale color scheme with wine red accents reflects the group's refined, professional style augmented by vocal and performance flare. The logo design is based on the group's previous logo.</p>

<p>After several design revisions, the final site was coded with HTML, CSS, and some basic JavaScript and PHP in Adobe Dreamweaver CS6.</p>

<h3>Deployment and maintenance</h3>

<p>The site underwent peer review and informal usability testing before launching in August 2014.</p>

<p>I actively maintain all site content and domain and hosting records, regularly updating the site with major gigs and announcements. As part of the group's digital initiative, I also manage the group's social media presence on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/basseswild) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/UMNBassesWild).</p>

<h3>2015 mobile redesign</h3>

<p>One year after the initial launch, I decided to refresh the site, implementing responsive design practices to cater to an increasingly mobile user demographic. The site retained its original content strategy and organization, but underwent a full visual redesign and under-the-hood improvements, including an upgrade to HTML5 and CSS3 structure. The home page utilizes a basic fluid CSS grid system and the logo was redesigned to more closely match the original. The redesign was launched in September 2015.</p>

	<h1>Writing Like Hendrix</h1>
	
    <p class="date">11 November 2015</p>
	<p>Funny how inspiration pops up in the strangest places. I’ve been considering what makes for a good writer, and thought about music as a parallel.</p>

<p>If you saw the movie trailer for Matt Damon’s latest interplanetary endeavor “The Martian,” you probably recognized the smash hit “All Along the Watchtower” as performed by the legendary guitar god Jimi Hendrix. It’s a classic, and possibly Hendrix’s top song of all time; it was his highest-ever ranking song on the Billboard charts.</p>

<p>The thing thing is, Hendrix didn’t even write the song. That honor goes to seasoned music/entertainment industry veteran Bob Dylan, the one and only. What?? Yep.</p>

<p>It’s pretty funny, actually. Dylan wrote “All Along the Watchtower” in 1967, and it was the second single off the album <em>John Wesley Harding</em>. Its reception was lukewarm. But when When Jimi Hendrix took it and made a cover six months later, it instantly jumped up on the charts, landing a Billboard Top 20 pot. Even Dylan himself liked it better than his own version. When he heard the song, Dylan said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It overwhelmed me, really. [Hendrix] had such talent, he could find things inside a song and vigorously develop them. He found things that other people wouldn’t think of finding in there. He probably improved upon it by the spaces he was using. I took license with the song from his version, actually, and continue to do it to this day.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think, and I hope, I take the same approach to my writing. I’ve been working with CLA for a while now, and I love helping each Department find its unique voice and develop it with my writing. I want to help storytellers dig deep into the essence of their message and bring out the important bits in all of it. Hendrix was a legend, no doubt. I hope I can live up to be just a fraction of the writer he was when I set my pen to paper (or my fingers to keyboard, I suppose).</p>

	<h1>Busy Isn't Better</h1>
	
    <p class="date"> 2 June 2015</p>
	<p>I’m a busy person. I load myself with responsibilities and commitments that I know are going to end up stressing me out and taxing my health. And as a soon-to-be-senior at University, it’s not an uncommon to be booked from sun-up to sun-down with class, work, friends, student groups, and other commitments too numerous to list.</p>

<p>Just this last semester, I managed a full-time academic credit load, worked three jobs, volunteered on the church worship team, and participated in two different student groups (for one of which I served on the executive team). I didn’t have a whole lot of time to relax or to do much of anything for fun. I spent the semester constantly thinking about how much work I had to accomplish, what homework and projects were due that week, and when I was going to get a chance to sleep next. It was exhausting.</p>

<p>Why do we do it to ourselves? Why do we overload on responsibilities and commitments? It’s good to keep yourself occupied and being productive. But do we place too much personal value in how “busy” we are? Think about it: so much of society pressures us to be “productive” and tells us that if we’re not constantly stressing out about how much stuff we have to do, we’re not as good as those people that are busy to the point of exhaustion. Let me make the argument: Busy isn’t better. Business detracts from our ability to fully commit to the things we love and are passionate about. Overloading ourselves prevents us from focusing on the things that matter to us and lessen our ability to succeed. Now, I’m not saying that we should sit around and be lazy—not at all. Let’s work to keep ourselves occupied and focused, not stressed out and overworked.</p>

<p>Business is glorified. When someone is constantly overworked, running from one thing to the next, deprived of sleep, and running on a gallon of coffee, do we tell them “You should take a break!” or “That’s not good for you, you need to take care of yourself?” No, we glorify them. “Wow that’s crazy, I don’t know how you do it!” “Dang, you’re amazing, you have so much on your plate.”
Oh, and don’t forget about the “one-upping” game:</p>

<p>“Man, I’m so tired, I’m running on two hours of sleep and I still haven’t finished this project.”
“That’s nothing, I haven’t slept in 48 hours and I’ve got to work a 12-hour shift soon.”
“I have two group projects, three assignments, and a four-hour rehearsal tonight. Then I have to be up at 5:30am to drive my friend to the airport, then two midterms back-to-back. Man, I’m so busy!”</p>

<p>“Oh yeah? I’ve got a 14-page paper to write, a group project to redo because my whole group sucks, and I have to work noon to close tonight. Then I work the overnight shift at my other job, and oh, don’t forget the three midterms I have tomorrow and then another six-page paper due the next day.”</p>

<p>It seems that almost every week, I’m playing this game of trying to “one-up” someone else; to be the busiest, most overworked, most stressed-out person. Why? What am I trying to prove? That I’m “better” than someone else or being “more productive” than them?
This year, I’m taking a step back. I’m finding the things that truly add value to my life, and cutting out all the rest. I want to make more time for the things that matter to me: school, music, good company, good food, friends, family, God. Never again do I want to half-ass all of my commitments to try and make time for just “one more thing” that I don’t need to make me happy and to live a fulfilling, meaningful life. I want to be able to say no things so that I have the time, energy, and integrity to say yes when something is important to me. I want to be focused, not busy. I encourage you to be the same.</p>

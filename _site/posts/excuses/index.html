	<h1>No More Excuses, Just Explanations</h1>
	
    <p class="date"> 9 April 2015</p>
	<p>I’ve always disliked “excuse” used as a noun. “What’s your excuse?” “This is my excuse.” “That’s no excuse!” There is nothing essentially wrong with excuses and situations in which you might have or use one, but there is a problem with the way that they tend to be used and how they affect the situation.</p>

<p>Let’s think about some common situations where an excuse might be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running late to a meeting</li>
  <li>falling asleep in class</li>
  <li>missing an assignment</li>
  <li>skipping the gym this week</li>
  <li>failing to pick up milk on the way home</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, situations in which you might use an excuse are ones in which you had some sort of responsibility that you failed to fulfill.</p>

<p>But it’s okay because you have an excuse!</p>

<ul>
  <li>ran out of gas</li>
  <li>stayed up late finishing a project</li>
  <li>accidentally fed homework to pet lizard</li>
  <li>had a busy work load</li>
  <li>traffic was heavy and you were tired</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all valid reasons that would cause the problems in the situations described. Here’s the problem: most of the time, our excuses are weak arguments. More often than not, these outside circumstances are things that might have been avoided with more forethought or are just the result of our own shortcomings. They’re things that we can control. Things that we can avoid.</p>

<p>Richard E. Vatz, a professor, rhetorician, and writer, refers to something called “evocative language” in his famous piece The Myth of the Rhetorical Situation. Evocative language is used by a speaker (intentionally or not) when he or she relates information regarding a situation. There is no escaping it: when someone speaks about a situation or tries to convey a message, that person uses language in such a way that emphasizes what he or she finds salient in that situation. The speaker uses persuasive words and language that shape the situation and affect others’ perception of events.</p>

<p>The word “excuse” is an excellent example of evocative language. While by definition it has no negative implications, there is a strongly negative cultural and social construction around the word such that it suggests the responsibility of the individual be de-emphasized. In downplaying the role of the actor in the scene, it places the situational blame on previous circumstances and events.</p>

<p>This is why I much prefer explanations to excuses.</p>

<p>An explanation, by contrast, is fair. It provides reasons for why something went wrong, and doesn’t place blame anywhere. It gets people thinking rationally and objectively about the factors that contributed to the present situation and the events that led up to it. Explanations get us thinking about what happened, why it happened, and how to fix it in the future.
When I drop the ball and fail to meet expectations (both external and self-imposed), I don’t want to use an excuse as a cover or justification for my shortcomings. I want to know what went wrong, where I could have done something to fix or avoid it, and how it needs to be addressed in the future. I want use my failures and mistakes as opportunities to learn and grow, and hopefully to become a character of greater reliability and integrity.</p>

<p>The next time you don’t make it to the gym for the 3rd day in a row, don’t create an excuse for it. Think about why you’re not finding the time or energy, and lay out an explanation. Think about what you can do about it to get back on schedule. The next time your instructor asks for that paper that’s a week overdue, don’t give him an excuse. Explain your situation and the objective reasons the paper isn’t in. Where could you have made some adjustments to get the paper in on time? Where do you need to improve? Who knows, maybe your instructor offer you some help or even an extension.</p>

<p>Sometimes there are valid reasons for our shortcomings and inconsistencies. And that’s okay–but let’s do our best to take responsibility and use them as opportunities to learn and improve. Provide explanations, not excuses.</p>

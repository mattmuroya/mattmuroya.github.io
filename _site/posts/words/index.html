	<h1>Words Are All We Have</h1>
	
    <p class="date">30 March 2015</p>
	<blockquote>
  <p>Words are all we have<br />We’ll be talking, we’ll be talking<br />These words are all we have<br />We’ll be talking</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s fascinating how fixated on words humans have come to be. Words are everywhere; words are everything. Words control our lives. They govern our thoughts and actions. They chronicle our history and they fabricate our future. They influence our relationships, carry our conversations, and make tangible our feelings and emotions. Words realize the things inside our heads. And although words don’t define us and who we are, they are all we have to understand and articulate it.</p>

<p>Words can carry a lot of weight. But what are words, really? Words, in and of themselves, mean nothing; words are just sounds (or series of sounds) that represent some concept or idea. By definition, a word is the smallest linguistic unit of a spoken or written language capable of conveying meaning. The distinction is that the word itself has no intrinsic meaning or literary value; it simply represents some concept or idea to be communicated.</p>

<p>This is a call for all of us to become more aware of language and how it influences us and those around us; as the age-old adage goes: to think before we speak.</p>

<p>Language can be confusing. How many times have you had an idea or wanted to describe something to someone, but were unable to find the words to accurately depict what you were thinking? How many times has a teacher or professor tried to explain some difficult concept to you, but the words she used just didn’t line up in your head? There’s the problem; sentience and human thought can never be accurately encompassed by words. Words are our only window into the world; we perceive everything we see, smell, hear, taste, and touch by instantly describing it to ourselves with words: I feel “happy.” That grass looks very “green.” That pie smells “good.” That guy’s voice sounds “nasally.” This tabletop feels “rough.” Our ability to analyze our surroundings, and even to express our inner feelings, is limited to the language and words that we’ve been taught. Our expressive freedoms are restricted by the scope of our vocabularies.</p>

<p>Imagine your pool of thought and expression as a large sheet of uncut cookie dough; you want to cut and bake your cookies, but you’re limited to the few shapes of the cookie cutters: teddy bears, stars, dinosaurs, Christmas trees, you name it. That’s all well and good, but the unfortunate truth of the matter is that no matter how hard you try or how many different cookie cutters you have, the shapes will never match up perfectly. There will always be some dough left over or your cookie cutter won’t fit in the space you want it to. It’s the same way with words; we, as speakers, are laden with outright impossible task of fitting into the limited scope of human language the vastness of thought, emotion, and being. It’s the reason there are so many different translations and versions of foreign or ancient texts. For example, the Bible has been translated time and time again, and still theologians and scholars debate which translation is “best” and which gets closest to the “true meaning” of the text. Due to the unfortunately imperfect nature of words, there will always be meaning that gets lost in translation.</p>

<p>Did you know that the ancient Greeks had at least four different words to describe the concept of love? By some scholars’ analyses, there might even have been as many as six or seven. Regardless, it doesn’t change the fact that in English, we’ve only got one word for it. I don’t need to tell you what a complex emotion love is. It would require a book the size of an elephant and we probably still wouldn’t reach any conclusions. The Greeks agreed; so they did what they could: they had multiple different words to describe love in its different forms, contexts, and situations. They understood that words limit our ability to express the scope of emotions we experience.</p>

<p>So we understand the limitations of language and words. But why do they still work? What is their value?</p>

<p>We give words meaning. Humans have given certain values, meanings, and sentiments to words. Words mean nothing unless they’ve been attributed value by the speaker. For example, imagine you’re in a room all by yourself. No one else is in the room with you, and as far as you know there’s no one within earshot. You stand up, stare into the empty space in front of you, and speak the words:</p>

<p>I love you.</p>

<p>The emptiness screams back at you with a deafeningly silent voice. What did your words mean? Why did you say them? What meaning went into those words? What was their impact on the audience? In this case, there wasn’t an audience. There wasn’t a self-generated reason for saying those words. Nothing went into them, no one heard them. The world around you remains unaltered.</p>

<p>The meaning changes when you say them in different contexts and with different intents. You might say them to your mother as she drops you off at school every morning. You might say them with your romantic partner as you stare into each other’s eyes over your Valentine’s Day dinner. You might say them to your child as you rock her gently back and forth, watching her slip into a peaceful sleep. You might say them before your brother’s flight overseas, savoring his embrace for the last time in God-knows-how-long.</p>

<p>Those three short words–”I love you”–have just taken on radically different meanings in each situation. And furthermore, each person reading this will place his or her own meaning into these words; meanwhile, the listeners will translate them in their own ways, filling in gaps and interpreting the words to the best of their abilities. Words, spoken, are meaningful when they have a speaker and a listener. We give words meaning.</p>

<p>And meaning changes with context and those people involved. Another example:</p>

<p>愛してる: aishiteru (eye-shee-TE-roo)</p>

<p>Chances are if you were to say this to your friend, classmate, coworker, it wouldn’t mean anything to either of you (that is unless you and/or your partner speaks Japanese–let’s assume for the purpose of this illustration that neither is the case). You’d utter the words, your partner would look at you funny, and that would be the end of that. You didn’t mean anything by your words, and your partner didn’t receive anything. Well, maybe your partner received some major weirdo-vibes, but the point is intact: the words themselves carried no intrinsic value or meaning; you could have replaced the phrase with “kookypooky” and the transmission of your intended message (or lack thereof) would have remained unchanged. The words themselves carried no meaning.</p>

<p>The word is Japanese for “I love you.” It takes on meaning for those that speak and understand the language. Context is just another piece in the fragile framework of language, our words, and their meanings.</p>

<p>None of this is to say that words are useless, nor is it to disparage society’s reliance on words. Quite the opposite; I praise the versatility of words. It is by words that I am able to outline, organize, and communicate my thoughts here–for you.</p>

<p>But it is an observation of the subjectivity of language. An observation that we grant words meaning and that words are fundamentally an imperfect, but necessary way of communicating.
This is an invitation to join with me in putting more thought and intent behind our words, respecting their power and being aware of their impact on us, on others, and how we experience the world around us.</p>

<p>Speak deliberately. Words are all we have.</p>
